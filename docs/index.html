                        <h3>Project Description</h3>
                        <p>This Library represents early work on secrets management. It uses a keepass database as a secure
                            store, (visit https://keepass.info for more information) </p>
                        <p>The concept is a simple case of secret storage and programmatic access, you create a Keepass
                            Database, store User/Application/System Secrets as entities within the database which can include
                            nearly limitless amounts of additional data. (Limited by 3 things, One: File size (Load Time), Two:
                            Storage Available, and Three: Search Method(s) Conditions) The application uses the search function
                            built into the library to find the entities by name.</p>
                        <p>My Customization allows you to call the configuration object like you’re used to. This returns the
                            string object that is stored in the keepass database. If it’s not found in the keepass database it
                            will look to local configuration files and storage methods included.</p>
                        <p>
                            <code>var SettingValue = Configuration.AppSetting[SettingsName]</code><br />
                        </p>
                        <p>The next version of the project has plans to implement the Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration library
                            and allow loading and consumption of enumerated lists of settings files and locations, the keepass
                            database will be included in that list. </p>

                        <p>
                            This Application was a demonstration of the Azure Cognitive services integration into a User Registration application developed for the Video series.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The concept wrapped around having a Home Automated Door Deadbolt Lock and Eyehole Camera. When you presented yourself to the door, the automated door Deadbolt Lock application (not apart of this project) would take a picture, using Accord framework (http://accord-framework.net/) to locally identify if the picture had a face within it. When a face was found, the image would then be sent to an API (again Not apart of this project) that would then be sent off to Azure for recognition and categorization, if the face belonged to a registered group (Registered within Azure Cognitive Services Face-API) the API using that information would use that information to check the local registration to validate the authorization the user had to the entry way. If they were authorized the system would then send off a signal to unlock the door. Unauthorized users would be cataloged, and an email would be sent to be reviewed.

                        <p>Development started in DiskPart Settings Text Files and now PowerShell 7 is used to manage all the things that
                            Diskpart and a settings file would do. PowerShell 7 is required.

                            Concept is to displace application files from a higher performing hard drive to a lesser one. [SSD -> HDD (platter drive)] In other words,
                            you can install an application using a VHDx File as the storage location in place of the folder using a Symbolic
                            Link (Junction) and move the VHDx Around as needed to better manage storage and performance rather than
                            uninstalling and reinstalling applications.</p>

                            This project was one of necessity. After 20+ years of collecting, developing and loosing/misplacing projects and
                            source files, When Windows 7 ( + Windows Server 2008) presented the ability to create Virtual Machines. Virtual
                            Hard drives became a standard in storing a lot of “Shared” data. I had virtual hard drives that I would attach
                            and detach from virtual machines to do maintenance and installations. </p>
                        <p>
                            A few years ago with the introduction of Windows 10, Hyper-V and Hyper-V PowerShell Module I was able to script
                            out the creation of Virtual Hard Drives and took the concept of sharing one step further by attaching these
                            drives to folders (Folder Mounting). </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With this I could in theory, install games onto to my SSD drive but when I wasn’t playing the game but needed
                            additional space on the then limited space of my SSD I could dismount and displace the VHD to a Cold storage
                            Spindle based drive (lesser performing drive) or even push the drive up to network storage for archiving. </p>
                        <p>
                            I took the theory one step further when I started working for GiftCertificates.com and used the virtual hard
                            drive storage process to section of projects and configurations in order to better my development performance
                            and time spent between different projects all while managing the space, and what was presented to me at any
                            given time in the work environment. </p>
                        <p>
                        <h6>Passing on the concept: </h6>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’ve taken my time to convert the large group of scripts and methods down to a concise and simple PowerShell
                            Module that will allow you to take a given folder on your system with a virtual hard drive that is mounted to
                            the folder but is stored separately. </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently the project is unfinished, but the base scripts needed to mount existing virtual hard drives at
                            startup are present. The generation methods for creating the mounting config files and scripts are in the source
                            but the automation of converting a given folder to a virtual hard drive backed storage folder is rather
                            scattered and currently not included in the source due to liability reasons. (an issue that I ran into is
                            corruption and deletion of files during moves, until I can ensure that this does not happen / cannot happen
                            within my scripts I’ve left these out. I, myself am required to manually move important folders due to the
                            scripts tenuous nature.)
