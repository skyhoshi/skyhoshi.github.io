                1: Not all my personal or pet projects are listed here,<br />Most of the ones I find inspiring are.<br /> doing so would create an unreadable and misunderstood mess.
                Some projects are clearly defined (and as such) are displayed here.
                Where other projects have not been fully "Realized" for example alot of my home automation projects involve small devices which are single projects in of themselves but
                are so highly customized that "Presenting" them would be confusing and hard to "Define" as the requirements and parts are Frankenstein'd across multiple projects
                and are highly likely never to be reassembled in the same way. <br />
                This "lack of repetition" in Home automation projects is only due to shifting requirements of the expected function of the device.

                    <h3>Project Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        This Library represents early work on secrets management. It uses a keepass database as a secure
                        store, (visit https://keepass.info for more information)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The concept is a simple case of secret storage and programmatic access, you create a Keepass
                        Database, store User/Application/System Secrets as entities within the database which can
                        include
                        nearly limitless amounts of additional data. (Limited by 3 things, One: File size (Load Time),
                        Two:
                        Storage Available, and Three: Search Method(s) Conditions) The application uses the search
                        function
                        built into the library to find the entities by name.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My Customization allows you to call the configuration object like you’re used to. This returns
                        the
                        string object that is stored in the keepass database. If it’s not found in the keepass database
                        it
                        will look to local configuration files and storage methods included.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <code>var SettingValue = Configuration.AppSetting[SettingsName]</code><br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next version of the project has plans to implement the Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
                        library
                        and allow loading and consumption of enumerated lists of settings files and locations, the
                        keepass
                        database will be included in that list.

                    <p>
                        This Application was a demonstration of the Azure Cognitive services integration into a User
                        Registration application developed for the Video series.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The concept wrapped around having a Home Automated Door Deadbolt Lock and Eyehole Camera. When
                        you presented yourself to the door, the automated door Deadbolt Lock application (not apart of
                        this project) would take a picture, using Accord framework (http://accord-framework.net/) to
                        locally identify if the picture had a face within it. When a face was found, the image would
                        then be sent to an API (again Not apart of this project) that would then be sent off to Azure
                        for recognition and categorization, if the face belonged to a registered group (Registered
                        within Azure Cognitive Services Face-API) the API using that information would use that
                        information to check the local registration to validate the authorization the user had to the
                        entry way. If they were authorized the system would then send off a signal to unlock the door.
                        Unauthorized users would be cataloged, and an email would be sent to be reviewed.

                        Concept is to displace application files from a higher performing hard drive to a lesser one.
                        [SSD -> HDD (platter drive)] In other words,
                        you can install an application using a VHDx File as the storage location in place of the folder
                        using a Symbolic
                        Link (Junction) and move the VHDx Around as needed to better manage storage and performance
                        rather than
                        uninstalling and reinstalling applications.

                        This project was one of necessity. After 20+ years of collecting, developing and
                        loosing/misplacing projects and
                        source files, When Windows 7 ( + Windows Server 2008) presented the ability to create Virtual
                        Machines. Virtual
                        Hard drives became a standard in storing a lot of “Shared” data. I had virtual hard drives that
                        I would attach
                        and detach from virtual machines to do maintenance and installations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A few years ago with the introduction of Windows 10, Hyper-V and Hyper-V PowerShell Module I was
                        able to script
                        out the creation of Virtual Hard Drives and took the concept of sharing one step further by
                        attaching these
                        drives to folders (Folder Mounting).

                        <h6>Theories and Practice:</h6>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With this I could in theory, install games onto to my SSD drive but when I wasn’t playing the
                        game but needed
                        additional space on the then limited space of my SSD I could dismount and displace the VHD to a
                        Cold storage
                        Spindle based drive (lesser performing drive) or even push the drive up to network storage for
                        archiving.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I took the theory one step further when I started working for GiftCertificates.com and used the
                        virtual hard
                        drive storage process to section of projects and configurations in order to better my
                        development performance
                        and time spent between different projects all while managing the space, and what was presented
                        to me at any
                        given time in the work environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h6>Passing on the concept: </h6>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’ve taken my time to convert the large group of scripts and methods down to a concise and
                        simple PowerShell
                        Module that will allow you to take a given folder on your system with a virtual hard drive that
                        is mounted to
                        the folder but is stored separately.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently the project is unfinished, but the base scripts needed to mount existing virtual hard
                        drives at
                        startup are present. The generation methods for creating the mounting config files and scripts
                        are in the source
                        but the automation of converting a given folder to a virtual hard drive backed storage folder is
                        rather
                        scattered and currently not included in the source due to liability reasons. (an issue that I
                        ran into is
                        corruption and deletion of files during moves, until I can ensure that this does not happen /
                        cannot happen
                        within my scripts I’ve left these out. I, myself am required to manually move important folders
                        due to the
                        scripts tenuous nature.)

                        This Application built in C# and Unity is designed to generate a database of all currently installed Steam Games.
                        Once compiled the game's steam cached images are used as items for matching in a "Slot Machine".
                        When the Slot machine is activated the dials spin with the images of the games on the dials and upon match the "Player" is then intended to start that game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The current design is intended to work with Only Already "Downloaded" games, that is games that the "Player" has used the steam client to "Install" but may not have "Run/Played" the game.
                        in other words, the game's inclusion is not dependent whether the game has been run or not, only installed.
                        This may mean that additional installation steps may be required in order to play the game.

                    This game is to be an advanced shoot'um up (shump) with a dynamic enemy AI, customizeable loadouts and on the fly systems alterations that provide the gamer a unique playthrough of each level depending on the player's loadout.

                    Example:<br />
                    When a player chooses guns with a fast firing rate and minimal power to a ship with high(strong) shields, enemies will have low shields and strong guns to break down the player's shields.
                    This is done by calculating attributes of the weapons system loadout and adjusting the enemies loadout, entry points and
